# Analyzing the robustness of Kronecker graphs of different sizes when inducing different error mechanisms

## About the project

This university group project

## Context of the project

This group project (see contributors) was conducted as part of the coursework of my Masters degree (Management & Data Science) in the summer term 2019. The task was to extend the Martin & Niemeyer (2019) paper by conducting the analysis described above.
